* Algebra and number theory.
	- [PR #11727](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11727) :: feat(number_theory): von Mangoldt function
	- [PR #11199](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11199) :: feat(field_theory/laurent): Laurent expansions of rational functions
	- [PR #9370](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/9370) :: feat(field_theory/is_alg_closed/classification): Classify algebraically closed fields
	- [PR #11780](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11780) :: feat(field_theory/krull_topology): defined Krull topology on Galois groups
	- [PR #11922](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11922) :: feat(algebra/lie/engel): add proof of Engel's theorem
	- [PR #11332](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11332) :: feat(data/nat/totient): add Euler's product formula for totient function
	- [PR #12213](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12213) :: feat(ring_theory/witt_vector): Witt vectors are a DVR

* Analysis.
	- The Cauchy integral formula ([PR #10000](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/10000), last month) unlocked elementary complex analysis, and now the applications are coming quickly.  This month saw [PR #11864](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11864) (the Cauchy-Goursat theorem for an annulus), [PR #12095](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12095) (Liouville's theorem), and [PR #12050](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12050) (the maximum modulus principle).
	- A particularly exciting application of the complex analysis work is [PR #11916](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11916), Gelfand's formula for the spectral radius of an element of a Banach algebra.  This is proved by considering the resolvent as a holomorphic function with values in the Banach algebra.
	- [PR #12123](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12123) :: feat(measure_theory/integral/set_integral): Bochner integral with respect to a measure with density

* Geometry: [PR #12236](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/12236) :: feat(geometry/euclidean/oriented_angle), the culmination of a series of PRs, defines the oriented angle between vectors in an oriented two-dimensional vector space.


* Combinatorics.
	- [PR #11248](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/11248) :: feat(combinatorics/set_family/lym): Lubell-Yamamoto-Meshalkin inequalities
	- [PR #4259](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/pull/4259) :: feat(archive/100-theorems-list): Partition theorem
